## Database

**Database:**  A database is an organized collection of data stored
               and accessed electronically. It provides a way to
               store, organize, and retrieve large amounts of data
               efficiently.

**Database Management System:** A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.
 It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database. 

 Database management systems were developed to handle the following difficulties of
 typical File-processing systems supported by conventional operating systems.
 1. Data redundancy and inconsistency
 2. Difficulty in accessing data
 3. Data isolation– multiple files and formats
 4. Integrity problems
 5. Atomicity of updates
 6. Concurrent access by multiple users
 7. Security problems

### Database Languages
- Data Definition Language
- Data Manipulation Language
- Data Control Language
- Transactional Control Language

### Data Definition Language
DDL is the short name for Data Definition Language, which deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.

- CREATE: to create a database and its objects like (table, index, views, store procedure, function, and triggers)
- ALTER: alters the structure of the existing database
- DROP: delete objects from the database
- TRUNCATE: remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed
- COMMENT: add comments to the data dictionary
- RENAME: rename an object

### Data Manipulation Language
DML is the short name for Data Manipulation Language which deals with data manipulation and includes most common SQL statements such SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc., and it is used to store, modify, retrieve, delete and update data in a database. Data query language(DQL) is the subset of “Data Manipulation Language”. The most common command of DQL is SELECT statement. SELECT statement help on retrieving the data from the table without changing anything in the table.

- SELECT: retrieve data from a database
- INSERT: insert data into a table
- UPDATE: updates existing data within a table
- DELETE: Delete all records from a database table
- MERGE: UPSERT operation (insert or update)
- CALL: call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram
- EXPLAIN PLAN: interpretation of the data access path
- LOCK TABLE: concurrency Control

### Data Control Language
DCL is short for Data Control Language which acts as an access specifier to the database.(basically to grant and revoke permissions to users in the database

- GRANT: grant permissions to the user for running DML(SELECT, INSERT, DELETE,…) commands on the table
- REVOKE: revoke permissions to the user for running DML(SELECT, INSERT, DELETE,…) command on the specified table

### Transactional Control Language
TCL is short for Transactional Control Language which acts as an manager for all types of transactional data and all transactions. Some of the command of TCL are

- Roll Back: Used to cancel  or Undo changes made in the database 
- Commit: It is used to apply or save changes in the database
- Save Point: It is used to save the data on the temporary basis in the database


|File Systems|DBMS|
| :---: | :---: |
| unstructured data | Structured data |
| we have to know the location to access  | no need of Location |
| Data redundancy and inconsistency  | no redundancy and maintain consistency |
| no concurrency | provides concurrency |
| no data integrity | data integrity |
| security is  less | high security |


### Types of DBMS Architecture
There are several types of DBMS Architecture that we use according to the usage requirements. Types of DBMS Architecture are discussed here.

- 1-Tier Architecture
- 2-Tier Architecture
- 3-Tier Architecture

#### 1-Tier Architecture
In 1-Tier Architecture the database is directly available to the user, the user can directly sit on the DBMS and use it that is, the client, server, and Database are all present on the same machine. For Example: to learn SQL we set up an SQL server and the database on the local system. This enables us to directly interact with the relational database and execute operations. The industry won’t use this architecture they logically go for 2-tier and 3-tier Architecture.
