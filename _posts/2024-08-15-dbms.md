## Database

**Database:**  A database is an organized collection of data stored
               and accessed electronically. It provides a way to
               store, organize, and retrieve large amounts of data
               efficiently.

**Database Management System:** is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while
 considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs which manipulate
 the database. 

 Database management systems were developed to handle the following difficulties of
 typical File-processing systems supported by conventional operating systems.
 1. Data redundancy and inconsistency
 2. Difficulty in accessing data
 3. Data isolationâ€“ multiple files and formats
 4. Integrity problems
 5. Atomicity of updates
 6. Concurrent access by multiple users
 7. Security problems
